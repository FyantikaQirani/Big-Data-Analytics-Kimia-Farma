# Kimia Farma Business Performance Analytics (2020â€“2023)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a virtual internship at **Kimia Farma** for the role of **Big Data Analytics Intern**.  
The main objective was to evaluate the business performance of Kimia Farma between **2020 and 2023** by analyzing transaction, product, inventory, and branch data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The following datasets were provided:
- `kf_final_transaction.csv`
- `kf_inventory.csv`
- `kf_kantor_cabang.csv`
- `kf_product.csv`

All datasets were imported into **Google BigQuery** as tables for further processing.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** â†’ Dataset preparation
- **Google BigQuery & SQL** â†’ Data storage, cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Google Looker Studio** â†’ Interactive dashboard and visualization

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology
1. **Data Import**: Uploaded the four CSV files into BigQuery.  
2. **Data Transformation**: Built an **analysis table** by joining and aggregating multiple datasets.  
   - Transaction details (ID, date, customer, branch).  
   - Branch information (city, province, rating).  
   - Product details (ID, name, actual price, discount, profit margin).  
   - Calculated fields: `nett_sales`, `nett_profit`, `persentase_gross_laba`.  
3. **Visualization**: Connected the analysis table to Looker Studio and created an interactive dashboard.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features

- Yearly Revenue Comparison (2020â€“2023)  
- Top 10 Provinces by Transaction Volume  
- Top 10 Provinces by Nett Sales
